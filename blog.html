        <p>Dear Friend,</p>

        <p>Welcome to my very first website ! Pretty cool, huh? During quarantine, like most people, I was blessed with the wonderful gift of time. And with more time than I was typically used to, I became bored. In my boredom I decided to use my boredom as a boost to be slightly more productive.. and voila - this is the result. Everything about this website down to the smallest minor details many may overlook was implemented with some markup text: HTML, a styling sheet: CSS and a programming language of JavaScript. </p>
        <br>
        <p>For those who have absolutely no background in coding, let me first explain what each of those bolder letters are because I too was once in your footsteps. At some point in life, you may have come across the words HTML, CSS and JavaScript. But what is this? Well, to put it simply they are what make up virtually any, and probably all websites you have ever used or visited in your lifetime. HTML - is the skeleton, or backbone of websites. When I first began researching and learning how to code I originally thought HTML was some super complex coding language - and to be honest it was kind of daunting at the start, but after countless hours spent on YouTube with some practice I soon got more comfortable with how HTML works.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You may be scratching your head now thinking, skeleton? markup? This is perhaps the most cliche and overused explanation for how websites operate but I tried thinking of another analogy to describe html and the best I could come up with was a tree. But that might be better used to describe something called git (I have another link to a blog post about that here) </p>
        <br>
        <p>To better understand what HTML is I recommend you to think back to early middle school - or whenever you first took human anatomy. When you look at a skeleton of the human body you can see what your body looks like from underneath. In the same way that the skeleton makes up your body - HTML makes up the underneath of all websites. HTML dictates and tells the web browser where things go. In a skeleton, there is a specific portion of bone that is designated for where the arm should go and the arm connects to the torso, from the torso to the stomach, and each component connects outwards to different other parts of the body. This is of course a massive oversimplification but I hope that this makes sense even if it’s only conceptual.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Cascading stylesheet, or CSS, is basically what makes websites look pretty. Everything from the specific font that is displayed, the size of the font, background coloring, how much spacing words have, you name it. Anything that involves making a website go from looking like this: </p>
        <br>
        <p>(Insert image) </p>
        <br>
        <pr>to looking like this:</pr>
        <br>
        <p>A handy trick that I haven’t gotten the full hang of yet is making simple animations with CSS. Simple animations may be a bit misleading because you can do some pretty “complicated” animations. But with simple animations - for those reading this on a desktop - if you hover your mouse over the navigation bar the titles change from a soft grey to a soft peach color.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This relatively simple “animation” took about a week to figure out. What’s even funnier - at least to me - is how it only takes up a few lines of code.</p>
        <br>
        <p>(Insert image css animation transition animation)</p>
        <br>
        <p>You can go on to learn a lot of nifty other things with CSS, I’ve really only scratched the surface, but I hope this helps you to understand what CSS is - even if its at a very basic level. In short CSS <b>ups</b> the presentation level of your websites significantly.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Now onto the big boy, JavaScript. Unlike HTML and CSS, this one is the actual programming language that is often embedded within websites. Any website, or applications, that you have used that makes images move, if the website has active interactive features (<i> e.g. </i>the webpage may react to your cursor hovering over aspects of the website) , to flashing animations or giving you Pop Up Alerts/ Warning Tabs is usually created with JavaScript. My site is a mostly static site and I haven’t fully mastered the syntax of JavaScript let alone have I been able to fully understand how it works, but with the mighty help of YouTube I was still able to implement a small bit of JavaScript.</p>
        <br>
        <p>When scrolling down the main portfolio page when you first open the site or when scrolling down this blog page you may have noticed that the navBar disappears as you scroll down the page. But if you reverse the direction the navBar will reappear. This small piece of code took <b>soo</b> long to figure out and how to implement it within my own webpage because I was originally under the impression you could do this with CSS. (You might be able to, but I was unsuccessful in finding how to do this using CSS) instead I found JavaScript to be far more successful and I’m pretty content with the result.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Overtime I will hope to add more blog posts ranging from Web Development to Photography using this as a personal journal/ record of my journey. I have no idea if anyone will read this, but for me it’s not that important as it is to keep a log of my progress. To use this as something I can look back upon once I’ve fully mastered JavaScript and Web Development in general.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Until next time.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Your friend,</p>
        <p>Rosa</p>
