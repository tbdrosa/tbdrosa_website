                How does one learn to say goodbye?
                <br />
                <br />
                There is no room for practice, really.
                <br />
                <br />
                One can never really prepare for it. You’re either a good liar, a great hugger or both.
                <br />
                <br />
                It hurts far more when it’s someone you care for. One moment they are here, and the next, they could be
                gone.
                <br />
                <br />
                They could be visiting another country, moving away to school or the more unfortunate... <br />
                Passing off into the ether.
                <br />
                <br />
                Lately, I’ve been thinking about these goodbyes, and how many times we are saying goodbye to some people
                we may never see or speak to ever again.
                <br />
                <br />
                Think back to high school how many people we were once spending our days and hours of our class times
                with – for a total of four years, and we may lose touch with them. Not a text or call. Just another face
                on our socials.
                <br />
                <br />
                Old lovers whom we all thought were the ones we were going to marry or the ones we had once believed
                were going to change our lives. The silly hookups we like to remember and reminisce – or cringe over.
                <br />
                <br />
                Each of these, whether they are lovers, partners, or friends they all fade into distant memories,
                eventually.
                <br />
                <br />
                But the thing that I think about most is how we forget who we were at those times, yet we remember them
                as we had once perceived them in those moments. In case that doesn’t make sense – we’ve all heard the
                saying that we weren’t the same person we were yesterday. Each day inspires growth; whether we notice
                that or not is irrelevant because it’s a slow and ever-growing process. And by saying goodbye – this
                forever cements our lasting memories of those people in our lives.
                <br />
                <br />
                As people grow – no one is the same person they were yesterday. Of course, you may think yes, that’s
                obvious. Cliché as fuck, I know, but as I was thinking about this, it helped me put these things into
                perspective.
                <br />
                <br />
                Now imagine for a moment you are outside of yourself – think about who you were and how you identified
                yourself as, whether it was a year, two years, or even three years ago... I’m sure you possibly cringe
                or even shudder at the thought of a younger version of your self
                <br />
                <br />
                It is in this same way – those ‘others’ who were once in our lives – they too think about us after our
                goodbyes. They too have changed in the same way – if not more than you have.
                <br />
                <br />
                What are we to do with this, and why is this important?
                <br />

                <br />
                No idea, but it’s something I’ve been thinking about a lot lately. There have been moments I’ve wanted
                to rekindle some friendships and old connections that may have gotten lost after our goodbyes.
                <br />
                <br />
                There’s a lot of people I miss, but I am sure they won’t – or can’t – say the same. Their lasting
                impression of me is forever cemented in the same way mine has of them. All during our last goodbyes.
                <br />
                <br />
                We all grow up sooner or later, and perhaps I am a bit slower than most.
                <br />
                <br />
                Perhaps people I miss will make their way back into my life. And the same may be true for you. But for
                now, I am trying to grow and be someone I can cringe at the thought of in five years time.
                <br />
                <br />
                People say time heals all wounds – another cliché, yet while I disagree that time has the ability to
                heal wounds, for me, it does help in the ability to grow and learn from these wounds.
                <br />
                <br />
                Were it not for the pain – perhaps we as people would never grow.
                <br />
                <br />
                And if you are reading this – and made it this far – if we used to talk once upon a time. My DMs are
                always open, many may be intimidated or annoyed by my constant posts, but most – if not all are meant as
                satire or heavily sarcastic meant to troll or spark further debate/discussion.
                <br />
                <br />
                Never take anything I post too seriously. I’m far more than what I post on social media. As are those of
                your other followers/ followings. There’s more to us than a page and silly posts.
                <br />
                <br />
                For the most part – I am an open book, so be careful with what it is you ask.
                <br />
                <br />
                Until next time.
                <br />
