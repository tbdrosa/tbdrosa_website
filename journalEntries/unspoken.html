                What words could I say to make it better? To help wipe your tears away, knowing that I am not there with
                you? I cannot be there to comfort you, to hug you, to hold you, to kiss you where I know it hurts. Who
                am I to speak to when I want to reach out but know I can’t—or at least shouldn’t? Do I defy the rules we
                set for one another? Am I to break the promises we made?
                <br />
                <br />
                You and I know that we tried our best. Or maybe we thought we did. Are we supposed to give up? Or should
                we try again?
                <br />
                <br />
                Failure is the best teacher. Teachers tell us that. Coaches, too. Anyone who has amounted to anything
                substantial or worthwhile has said it—at least to me. And we both know that failure doesn’t mean
                anything to me. I have failed more than most—went to school, dropped out, changed majors more than once.
                And still, despite what everyone has told me, despite the mockery and doubt, failure just pushes me
                forward. I may not get it right away, but I do my best.
                <br />
                <br />
                Which isn’t to say that others don’t try their best. But I can’t speak for them. I can only speak for
                myself. And I know that I love you. And I will always do everything in my power never to give up—whether
                it’s for you or for anything. It’s not in my nature to give up. I will continue to try.
                <br />
                <br />
                But at what point is it enough?
                <br />
                <br />
                I think we try and try and try, like Ord from that silly dragon cartoon on PBS. In one episode, they
                were playing soccer—or sky soccer, I think—and Ord kept messing up. He felt like giving up. But everyone
                told him he just needed to keep trying, to keep practicing. He wouldn’t be perfect right away, but with
                time, he would get better.
                <br />
                <br />
                In <i>Spider-Man 2</i>, Rosie—Dr. Otto Octavius’s wife—suggests the same thing. She says that her
                relationship with Otto wasn’t perfect, that they had to keep working at it. Their minds worked
                differently—Otto, the scientist, the engineer, the logical thinker. Rosie, the artist, the literary
                mind. Just like Peter and MJ. It’s a beautiful parallel because both stories mirror the same truth:
                anything worthwhile isn’t about giving up.
                <br />
                <br />
                That truth goes beyond relationships. It extends to hobbies, passions, careers—everything. <br />
                <br />
                But bringing it back to us, maybe we lost sight of what made us fall in love in the first place. What
                made us happy. We’re both busy with schoolwork, and by the time we’re home, we hardly have time for each
                other. We lost sight of that. We lost focus, took each other for granted—something I never thought I
                would do to you, not in a million years. Because you know how much I love and care for you.
                <br />
                <br />
                Maybe we just need to step back and reevaluate what we need from one another. Not lose sight of what’s
                important. Of what made us work. That doesn’t mean we don’t belong together. It just means we need to
                slow down, to refocus.
                <br />
                <br />
                I would be a fool to let this end us. Maybe some would call me stupid for holding on, but that’s not
                love—not to me.
                <br />
                <br />
                I will keep trying.
                <br />
                <br />
                <em><b>We</b></em> will keep trying
                <br />
                <br />
                And my only hope is that we can find a way back together. Because if only one of us tries, then maybe it
                really is time to close this chapter in our story. <br />
                <br />
                And even then, I still think we’re worth saving.
                <br />
                <br />
                Yours always,
                <br />
