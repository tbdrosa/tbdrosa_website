    <h2>Test Shoot</h2>
    <h3>Testing Out New Camera with Elijah Rodriguez</h3>

    <div class="journalEntryBody">
        <p> This shoot was probably the week of March 15, 2020. I distinctly remember it being a Thursday <em>right</em> before the United States and the rest of the world shut down. It had to have been a Thursday because I had a massive Calculus exam the following week, and many of my classmates, along with myself, were eager for the exam to be canceled and rescheduled to a later date. Little did we know what would soon come to pass.
            <br>
            <br>That same day – after I arrived home from class, the camera I had purchased and ordered off Depop about a month prior finally shipped and arrived at my house.
            <br>
            <br>My mother, of course, gave me about three Clorox-wipes to bathe in disinfectant. It was still the early phases of the Covid Shutdown. Not many of us regular civilians were fully aware of the severity of the situation – nor did we fully understand how the virus seemed to travel. I remember many conspiracy theories; covid lasts up to several weeks to months on a surface with no way of getting rid of it; it's difficult to clean once it gets on your hands; the list is ridiculously endless. Of course, this was largely due to the media trying to underwhelm and not cause massive panic, along with the lack of leadership we had in the White House.
            <br>
            <br>While all of this was going on in the "background," I texted one of my oldest friends, Elijah, if he had wanted to go on a test shoot since I had just come into contact with my new camera and had no way of knowing if the camera worked. I required a model, and he was surprisingly free. It's often the case whenever I'm free, my friends are super busy – or working. After grabbing my film stock from the fridge, we met underneath the One Train platform on 242nd and decided to walk through Van Courtland aimlessly.
            <br> All the shots were taken with my buddy and fellow photographer, <a class="eliInsta" href="https://www.instagram.com/elijahxrod/"><b>Elijah Rodriguez</b></a> on my ‘new’ <b><em>Canon Sure Shot Max Date.</em></b></p>

        <p class="note"><em>** Kodak Color Plus film stock</em></p>
        <p>I loved each of these images despite some having a few imperfections. I am usually disappointed after shooting an entire film roll and receiving photos with really dark shadows or blown-out highlights. Yet, many of these shots managed to turn out beautifully. I am not sure if it was the specific film stock that I had used or the camera itself. As we were walking, I did not have much of an idea before shooting – the <i>most</i> thinking I would do would have been to find some exciting backgrounds to frame my portrait. The repetition in images is because I took two photos to thoroughly test the camera’s capabilities – one with flash and one without it.
            <br>
            <br>I was taken aback by how good the camera ultimately worked under the grim low-lighting outdoors. I took a lot of these images blindly. Whenever I looked through the viewfinder, I could hardly see any detail and was using my iPhone flash for external light to frame the shot.
            <br>
            <br>I was also really surprised by how well it seemed to capture movement. The cover image was taken when Elijah ran to grab his bag and swerved around. The flash, of course, helped capture the movement, but at the time I originally thought it would have been a blurry waste of a slide.
            <br>
            <br>Overall, really impressed with how the <em> Sure Shot</em> performed under its conditions.
            <br>
            <br>Until next time.
            <br>
            <br>Your friend,
            <br>
            <br>Rosa</p>
