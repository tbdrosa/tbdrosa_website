        <h6 class="lazy-load">10.13.2020<br /><br /><i>~4 min read</i></h6>

        <div class="journalEntryBody lazy-load">
            <p>
                About two years ago my family and I went on a trip to Rhode Island. On our trip we went to several
                museums – my favorites were a part of the Newport Mansions. The Newport Mansions is an organization that
                helps maintain and preserve the best architectural pieces located in Rhode Island. We visited a
                collection of ‘museums’ that were once owned by the Vanderbilt family.
                <br />
                <br />
                The series of mansions were apparently considered <em> cottages</em> – a very humble term if you ask me.
                These were by no means what one would call a cottage today. They were massive in stature and each of the
                rooms was as big as you could imagine. They were so big I am confident you could fit two or three
                <b>full-sized</b> Hummer SUVs. Of course the Vanderbilt’s were one of <i>thee</i> wealthiest families in
                the late 1800s.
                <br />
                <br />
                Recently, I just finished <em> The Haunting of Hill House</em>, and looking back to my visit of these
                mansions I would not be surprised if the Vanderbilt children were terrified of the long corridors and
                passageways. The first twelve images were taken at <b> The Breakers</b>, I believe (it was a long time
                ago so some images might be from one of the other houses :p).
                <br />
                <br />
                To me, the images are a bit uninteresting and the framing is a bit poor because it was still in the
                beginnings of my photography career.

                <br />
                <br />Still, hope you enjoy the thread!

            <p>
                The last few images were taken from the balcony which was so beautiful. I tried best to capture the
                lighting in all its shine, but no matter how many images I took it did not amount to the breathtaking
                view one would see with their own eyes. Throughout the entire ‘tour’ I did not feel any images would do
                the scenery justice.
                <br />
                <br />
                The images after the exit sign were taken at the <b>Marble House</b>. This house was definitely my most
                favorite simply because the interior design was far more interesting, and the kitchen was absolutely
                breathtaking. Apparently, they had a large kitchen staff of chefs who would cook them various meals.
                They would be served a series of dishes until they were completely stuffed. From what I remember, the
                meals they received were not small courses but rather a full on plater. Each dish was purposely never
                finished so the family could <em>save</em> room in their stomachs for the next coming entrée.
                <br />Unfortunately, I don’t have that many images from this house simply because I was focusing on the
                actual layout and design of the interior during the Marble House tour. The rooms were designed with
                windows that were massive; this way they were able to take full advantage of the natural lighting. So,
                this is all that I have from the trip.
                <br />
                <br />
                I don't remember all the facts from each tour, but there were several that I found quite interesting.
                First, the world-renowned architect, Richard Morris Hunt, was the genius behind Marble House’s design –
                this might be one of the reasons why Marble House is often considered to be many peoples’ favorite. The
                second fact that I distinctly remember was how no one really used this house even after its construction
                was completed; however, the few times the Vanderbilt family did use the house, I believe it was mostly
                to host parties. I could only imagine these parties being quite Gatsby-esque.
                <br />
                <br />
                The last building near the water, the one that seems very out of place, is a Chinese Tea House built by
                Ava Belmont, where she held meetings as she plotted and organized events with various other women that
                would further her fight for women to earn the right to vote. I encourage anyone who reads this, if they
                find themselves in Rhode Island sometime in the future after the pandemic’s stricter restrictions have
                been uplifted and more museums and tourist attractions begin opening up, please do yourself a favor and
                visit! <br />If you are interested you can find out more information
