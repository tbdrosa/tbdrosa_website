    <h2>Family Road Trip</h2>
    <h3>visiting Rhode Island’s most extravagant mansions</h3>

    <div class="journalEntryBody">
        <p>About two years ago my family and I went on a trip to Rhode Island. On our trip we went to several museums – my favorites were a part of the Newport Mansions. The Newport Mansions is an organization that helps maintain and preserve the best architectural pieces located in Rhode Island. We visited a collection of ‘museums’ that were once owned by the Vanderbilt family.</p>

        <p>The series of mansions were apparently considered <em> cottages</em> – a very humble term if you ask me. These were by no means what one would call a cottage today. They were massive in stature and each of the rooms was as big as you could imagine. Of course, the Vanderbilts were a part of <i>thee</i> wealthiest of families in the late 1800s.</p>

        <p>Recently, I just finished <em> The Haunting of Hill House</em>, and looking back to my visit of these mansions I would not be surprised if the Vanderbilt children were terrified of the long corridors and passageways. The first twelve images were taken at <b> The Breakers</b>, I believe (it was a long time ago so some images might be from one of the other houses :p).
            <br>
            <br> To me, the images are a bit uninteresting and the framing is a bit poor because it was still in the beginnings of my photography career.</p>

        <p>Still, hope you enjoy the thread!</p>

        <p> The last few images were taken from the balcony which was so beautiful. I tried best to capture the lighting in all its shine, but no matter how many images I took it did not amount to the breathtaking view one would see with their own eyes. Throughout the entire ‘tour’ I did not feel any images would do the scenery justice.</p>

        <p>The images after the exit sign were taken at the <b>Marble House</b>. This house was definitely my most favorite simply because the interior design was far more interesting and the kitchen was absolutely breathtaking. Apparently, they had a large kitchen staff of chefs who would cook them various meals. They would be served a series of dishes until they were completely stuffed. From what I remember, the meals they received were not small courses but rather a full on plater and each dish wouldn’t be finished so the family could <em>save</em> space for the next entrée.
            <br>Unfortunately, I don’t have that many images from this house simply because I was focusing on the actual layout and design of the interior during the Marble House tour. The rooms were designed with windows that were massive, this way they were able to take full advantage of the natural lighting. So, this is all that I have from the trip.</p>
        <p>I don't remember all the facts from each tour, but there were several that I found quite interesting. First, the world renowned architecht, Richard Morris Hunt, was the genuis behind Marble House’s design – this might be one of the reasons why Marble House is often considered to be many peoples favorite. The second fact that I distinctly remember was how no one really used this house even after its construction was completed; however, the few times the Vanderbilt family did use the house, I believe it was mostly to host parties. I could only imagine these parties being quite Gatsbyesque The last building near the water, the one that seems very out of place, is a Chinese Tea House built by Ava Belmont, where she held meetings as she plotted and organized events with various other women that would further her fight for women to earn the right to vote.</p>

        <p>I encourage anyone who reads this, if they find themselves in Rhode Island sometime in the future after the pandemic’s stricter restrictions have been uplifted and more museums and tourist attractions begin opening up please do yourself a favor and visit!
