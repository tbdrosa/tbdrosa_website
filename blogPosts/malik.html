                Dear friend,
                <br />
                <br />
                I am writing this after the fantastic results on this historic day. For whatever reason that I cannot
                seem to pinpoint, today has inspired me to write a mini blog post - I am dedicating this to my fellow
                photographers – or artists in general.
                <br />
                <br />
                Have you ever created a piece of art and had fun doing it, but afterward, when you looked it over, you
                hated it all? <br /><br />I, too, have been there—far more times than I would be able to count. The best
                advice I can give those of you who have also experienced this is to put it away. Put it somewhere safe
                where you can <em>guarantee</em> it will not get lost or damaged.
                <br />
                <br />Leave it alone for a while.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Don’t touch it.</b>
                <br />
                <br /><i>Please</i>, do not come back to it until you forget that you even made it.
                <br />
                <br />
                I admit this is not revolutionary advice; however, it is something that I have been doing for the better
                part of a year now. I often take a long time with my photo editing for any shoot that I have done for
                free. The reason for my slow pace is all a part of my creative process. During these free shoots, I can
                use this extra time to experiment with my editing of color tones and the overall mood of each image. I
                don’t believe I have one specific style because, in my opinion, it is always changing.
                <br />
                <br />
                With these photoshoots, I generally save them on my two hard drives
            </p>

            <blockquote class="journalEntryBody lazy-load">
                <p>“Back up your images &#38; back up your back ups!”</p>
                <p>“<b>ALWAYS</b>”.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                and leave them there until I forget that I have them. But first, be sure to back up your images and back
                up your back ups! <b>ALWAYS</b>. I have a Macbook, so I am unsure if there is a PC version to this
                method, but I can mark these folders with a colored circle. I often use <b>red</b> and <b>purple</b>,
                where <b>red</b> indicates that they are RAW files that I have not yet edited. <b>Purple</b> is for
                images I have yet to return to look over. About a month or two later, I go over the photos; once
                completed, I export them to a folder with a green circle indicating I have fully edited them.
                <br />
                <br />
                I began this process because I, like most artists, am overly critical of my work – especially if they
                are brand new. However, once I return to them after having forgotten, part of this forgetting removes
                the work's critical nature, and looking at them with a set of <i>‘fresh’</i> eyes makes them look far
                better than I initially thought. Unfortunately, for those painters, there might be limitations to this
                since coming back and changing something is a bit more complicated – not impossible, but still a bit
                more challenging than someone who is creating art digitally. Still, I feel the principal of this could
                still apply. You may hate your piece, but come to love it later on. I hope this inspires you to create
                something. To forget about it so that you can fall in love with your art all over again.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can confirm that this works because after the shoot with Shahnila - she also wasn’t a fan of the
                images. Shahnila said she felt that she didn’t look her best and that the lighting was quite dark. At
                the time, these were still only RAW files, so her statements were all valid criticisms. Now about seven+
                months have passed since the shoot, and I can say Shahnila loves them too! Try it out and let me know
                how it goes :D
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
                The following series of images are from a <em>while</em> ago. I hope you enjoy them just as much as I
                did while editing them. <br /><br />
                <b>*disclaimer:*</b> <br />some friends of mine have reached out to say that some of the photos look
                orange. To be honest, I am not sure why that is - on my computer the skin tones look perfectly fine. It
                might have something to do with either the true tone on your device or retina display.
