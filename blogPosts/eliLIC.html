                Dear Friend,
                <br />
                <br />
                It’s been a while. A long long while since my previous post.
                <br />
                Can’t believe it’s been nearly two years.
                <br />
                <br />I thought I’d post some images using my new Sony α 7 iii. I have to say that prior to officially
                using it, I regretted my purchase. The sole reason is that it’s massively expensive – and is the most
                expensive camera I have ever purchased. Secondly, and most importantly, I had not planned on upgrading
                my setup anytime soon. I have been using the Sony α6000 for about four years, and I have been quite
                content with its delivery.
                <br />
                <br />

                The Sony α6000 is a solid entry-level mirrorless camera and holds up quite well in most conditions. The
                only cons are that it felt a bit lightweight and “<i>cheap</i>” - I use that word <i>cheap</i> rather
                loosely because the camera itself was far from affordable. However, the tiny body and its design are
                what come across to me as “cheap.” I would find myself gripping the camera rather tightly because of its
                thin frame of a build. It may be a bit pedantic, but if one is shooting for several hours to years, one
                notices these small things on their camera.
                <br />
                <br />
                As one might have already deduced, the purchase was definitely an impulse buy.
                <br />
                <br />
                I often goof with my friends about it and poke fun at myself when discussing my purchase because I often
                mock photographers who may suffer from <em>G</em>.<em>A</em>.<em>S</em>. No, not that type of gas, but
                <em>G</em>.<em>A</em>.<em>S</em>. (Gear Acquisition Syndrome). As the acronym suggests, it’s the
                incessant need to buy new cameras and other sh*t that is not needed. It’s a common disease many
                photographers face every now and again. Most common among newbie photographers.
                <br />
                <br />
                Those with <em>G</em>.<em>A</em>.<em>S</em> are usually among these beginner-level photographers who
                regularly compare their style and setup and see these “influencers” who post beautiful artwork. These
                “influencers” often use <em>fancy schmancy</em> cameras. The rookies self-reflect and convince
                themselves they will underperform with a canon t6i or some other entry-level DSLR and want to
                overcompensate with a $3,000+ camera. It’s a hard pill to swallow, but in the same way, a freshman
                varsity basketball player may wish to be like Michael Jordan, Kobe, or Lebron; they are unfairly
                comparing themselves with someone on a completely different plane of experience.

                Now was this me suffering from <em>G</em>.<em>A</em>.<em>S</em>? Maybe? I am not even sure because if it
                is, then I have allowed myself to become a hypocrite, so I guess we all are guilty of suffering from
                <em>G</em>.<em>A</em>.<em>S</em>. Although, I will add that I wasn’t feeling the need to copy
                <i>Peter McKinnon</i>, nor did I want to copy the former goat <i>Bleeblu</i> (now known as
                <i>gitpuller</i>), or even the fantastic <i>dfreske</i>. All amazing artists I once followed have either
                quit, lost their drive, or have cringely morphed themselves into Instagram bureaucrats catering to the
                almighty algorithm.
                <br />
                <br />
                Always remember, when creating art, never do it for the likes, or the views, do it because you love it.
                Once you succumb to the eye of Sauron (the evil social media companies and silicon valley), we lose what
                it means to be an artist. Even the word “creator” now leaves an awful distaste in my mouth. I actually
                cringe-shuddered just thinking about the dilution of what it means to be a <em>creator</em>.
                <br />
                <br />
                The series of images above was a test shoot to dictate my ability to handle the camera – and to see what
                the camera could handle under extremely sunny and relatively overexposed settings. So I used my buddy
                <a class="eliInsta" href="https://www.instagram.com/elijahxrod/" target="blank"
                    ><b>Elijah Rodriguez</b></a
                >
                as a test shoot, and he took me to one of his favorite spots to shoot.
                <br />
                <br />
                Anyways, despite my purchase being rather impulsive with little to no thinking, I am glad that I did
                because it has allowed me to do some things I probably would not have been able to with my previous
                camera. Here’s to pushing the limits to one’s own setup. 🥂
                <br />

                Until next time.
