            <h2> Biography</h2>
            <p>Hi! Welcome to my portfolio. I’d like to break away from the whole <i>third person shtick</i>. I prefer using my own words to share my thoughts and experience. My name is John Anthony Rosa I’m a self-taught photographer and web-developer from New York City.
                <br>
                <br>Ever since I was a child I’ve had a huge passion for learning and creating art, whether that involved taking apart items in my house and building something or reading anything I could get my hands on.
                <br>
                <br>If I am not out with my friends creating art then I am busy in the library studying for my next exam. And If I am not in the library – then I am probably lost in a bookstore corner reading.
            </p>

        <div class="expertiseTextBlock">
            <h2>Expertise</h2>
            <p>My work focuses on mostly on portraits and my goal when creating art is to capture the moment that I genuinely hope makes you feel something when you look at my images. Pairing my <em>cheap</em> lenses with natural light gives my photographs a soft pastel feel.</p>

    <!--<p class="aboutText"> I’m not really one for the whole third-person "shtick". I’d prefer to break away from all that and use my own words to share my thoughts.</p>
    <p class="aboutText"> I live in New York City, - although as I’m writing this I have been social distancing up in Pennsylvania. Hopefully you will be reading this <em>far</em> after quarantine is over. When we’re not in quarantine, you can surely find me out and about in the city with my friends exploring the city. If you can’t find me in the city, I’m probably studying for my next exam or trying to teach myself something new off of the internet. If I’m not doing either of those things, then I’m probably reading. On my spare time - whenever I find some - I often like to read and write. </p>
    <p class="aboutText"> I’m taking this extra time, now during quarantine, to edit some short stories I started <i>way</i> back when in middle school. I hope to edit those stories and eventually turn this site into something more engaging rather than scrolling past the one or maybe two "cool" pictures I post up online. </p>
    <p class="aboutText">If work isn’t personal, what’s the purpose? I really love sharing my thoughts and ideas with my friends and hope (whether we’re in quarantine or not ) that you may find some encouragement to do the same; and maybe a smile or two while reading my future blogs. Perhaps this may also encourage you to create your own blog/page or atmosphere to share your ideas in whatever medium you may find appealing.</p>-->
