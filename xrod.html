    <h3>Testing Out New Camera with Elijah Rodriguez</h3>

        <p> With my buddy and fellow photographer Elijah Rodriguez. This shoot was probably the week of March 15, 2020. I distinctly remember it being a Thursday <em>right</em> before the United States and the rest of the world shut down. It had to have been a Thursday because I had a heavy Calculus exam the following week and many of my classmates, along with myself, were eager for the exam to be pushed back.. Little did we know what would soon come to pass...
            <br>
            <br>That same day – after I arrived home from class the camera I had purchased and ordered off Depop about a month prior finally shipped and arrived at my house.
            <br>
            <br>My mother, of course, gave me about three windex-wipes to bathe in disinfectant. It was still the early phases of the Covid Shutdown. Not many of us regular civilans were fully aware of the severity of the situation – nor did we fully understand how the virus seemed to travel. I remember an array of conspiracy theories it lasts up to several weeks to months on a surface with no way of being able to get clean it away. Of course, this was largely due to the media trying to underwhelm and not cause massive panic along with the lack of leadership we had in the White House. While all of this was going on in the "background" I texted one of my oldest friends, Elijah, if he had wanted to go on a test shoot since I had just come into contact with my new camera and had no way of knowing if the camera actually worked. I was in need of a model and he was surprisingly free. It's often the case whenever I'm free my friends are super busy – or working. We met underneath the One Train platoform on 242nd and decided to walk through Van Courtland aimlessly.</p>

    <!-- <p>Dear Friend,</p>

        <p>Welcome to my very first website! Pretty cool, huh? During quarantine, like most people, I was blessed with the wonderful gift of time. And with more time than I was typically used to. In my boredom I decided to be slightly more productive.. and voila - this is the result. Everything about this website, down to the smallest minor details that many may overlook, was implemented with some markup text: HTML, a styling sheet: CSS and a programming language of JavaScript. </p>
        <br>
        <p>For those who have absolutely no background in coding, let me first explain what each of those bolder letters are because I was once in your footsteps. At some point in life, you may have come across the words HTML, CSS and JavaScript. But what is this? Well, to put it simply they are what make up virtually any, and probably all, websites you have ever used or visited in your lifetime. HTML - is the skeleton of websites. When I first began researching and learning how to code I originally thought HTML was some super complex coding language - and to be honest it was kind of daunting at the start, but after countless hours spent on YouTube with some practice I soon became comfortable with how HTML works.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You may be scratching your head now thinking, skeleton? markup? This is perhaps the most cliché and overused explanation for how websites operate. I tried thinking of another analogy to describe html and the best I could come up with was a tree. That might be better used to describe something called git (I have another link to a blog post about that here) </p>
        <br>
        <p><b>What is HTML?</b></p>
        <p>To better understand what HTML is, I recommend you think back to early middle school - or whenever you first took human anatomy. When you look at a skeleton of the human body you can see what your body looks like from underneath. In the same way that the skeleton makes up your body - HTML makes up the underneath of all websites. HTML dictates where things go in a web browser. In a skeleton, there is a specific portion of bone that designates where the arm goes and where the arm connects to the torso, from the torso to the abdomen. Each component connects outwards to different parts of the body. This is of course a massive oversimplification, but I hope that this makes sense even if it’s only conceptual.</p>
        <p><b>What is CSS?</b></p>
        <p>Cascading stylesheet, or CSS, is basically what makes websites look pretty. Everything from the specific font that is displayed, the size of the font, background coloring, how much spacing words have, you name it. Anything that involves making a website go from looking like this: </p>
        <br>
        <p>(Insert image) </p>
        <br>
        <p>to looking like this:</p>
        <br>
        <p>A handy trick that I haven’t gotten the full hang of yet is making simple animations with CSS. Simple animations may be a bit misleading due to some of the complications you can create. But with simple animations - for those reading this on a desktop - if you hover your mouse over the navigation bar, the titles change from a soft grey to a soft peach color.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This relatively simple “animation” took about a week to figure out. What’s even funnier - at least to me - is how it only takes up a few lines of code.</p>
        <br>
        <p>(Insert image css animation transition animation)</p>
        <br>
        <p>You can go on to learn a lot of nifty other things with CSS – I’ve really only scratched the surface - but I hope this helps you understand what CSS is – even if its at a very basic level. In short CSS <b>ups</b> the presentation level of your websites significantly.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>What is JavaScript?</b></p>
        <p>Now onto the big boy, JavaScript. Unlike HTML and CSS, this one is the actual programming language that is often embedded within websites. Any website, or applications, that you have used that makes images move: if the website has active interactive features (<i> e.g. </i>the webpage may react to your cursor hovering over aspects of the website) , to flashing animations, Pop Up Alerts, or Warning Tabs, is usually created with JavaScript. My site is a mostly static site and I haven’t fully mastered the syntax of JavaScript, let alone have I been able to fully understand how it works, but with the mighty help of YouTube I was still able to implement a small bit of JavaScript.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As you first open the site you are welcomed by the portfolio and whether you scrol down on the index page or on this Blog page you may have noticed that the navBar disappears as you move down. But, if you reverse the direction, the navBar will reappear. This small piece of code took <b>soo</b> long to figure out and implement within my own webpage because I was originally under the impression you could do this with CSS. (You might be able to, but I was unsuccessful in finding how) instead I found JavaScript to be far more successful and I’m pretty content with the result.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Overtime, I will hope to add more blog posts ranging from Web Development to Photography using this as a personal journal and record of my journey. I have no idea if anyone will read this, but for me that’s not important. What’s important to me is to keep a log of my progress. To use this as something I can look back upon once I’ve fully mastered JavaScript and the intricacies of Web Development.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Until next time.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Your friend,</p>
        <p>Rosa</p>
